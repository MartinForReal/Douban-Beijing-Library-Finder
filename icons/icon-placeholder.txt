Icon files needed for the extension:

1. icon-16.png - 16x16 pixels (for browser toolbar)
2. icon-48.png - 48x48 pixels (for extension management page)
3. icon-128.png - 128x128 pixels (for Chrome Web Store/Edge Add-ons)

Recommended icon design:
- Book icon with library symbol
- Use colors that match both Douban (green) and library (blue) themes
- Simple, clear design that's recognizable at small sizes

You can create these icons using:
- Online tools like favicon.io or iconifier.net
- Design software like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe Illustrator
- Free icon generators

For now, the extension will work without icons, but adding them will improve the user experience.
